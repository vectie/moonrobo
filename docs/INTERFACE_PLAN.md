# Interface Plan

Moonrobo needs an operator surface before it needs autonomy. The first
interface should make robot state, safety state, and evidence obvious.

The interface is built with Rabbita for the web cockpit and Lepus for the
desktop shell.

## Product Shape

```text
Moonrobo Cockpit
  RobotBook explorer
  robot digital twin
  telemetry rail
  command-intent queue
  safety verdict panel
  approval drawer
  replay timeline
  bridge health
  Moontown resident-agent status
```

## First Screen

The first screen should be the usable cockpit, not a landing page.

Required first-screen elements:

- selected robot identity
- bridge health
- current mode
- telemetry freshness
- digital twin viewport
- joint/sensor summary
- command queue
- safety status
- latest receipt

## Main Views

### Robot

For inspecting embodiment:

- model viewport
- joint list
- sensor list
- capability list
- calibration and model warnings

### Telemetry

For live observation:

- latest frame timestamp
- stale/healthy state
- mode
- joint values
- IMU values
- operator input
- bridge errors

### Command

For proposed actions:

- command intent editor
- parameter controls
- dry-run button
- safety verdict
- approval state
- execute button only when allowed
- emergency stop or hold control

### Replay

For evidence review:

- receipt list
- timeline scrubber
- telemetry frame viewer
- command intent and verdict
- bridge result
- artifacts

### Town

For Moontown integration:

- resident robot card
- standing goals
- scheduled tasks
- current assignment
- maintenance notices
- recent incidents

## Desktop Shell

Lepus should package:

- Moonrobo MoonBit service
- Rabbita cockpit
- selected bridge sidecars
- scoped RobotBook file access
- local logs and receipts
- service lifecycle controls

The desktop shell should not become the scheduler or durable knowledge owner.
It hosts the operator cockpit and local sidecars.

## UI Rules

- Physical execution controls must be visibly safety-gated.
- The execute control is disabled unless the latest verdict allows execution.
- Stale telemetry must be a first-screen signal.
- Bridge errors must be visible and linked to receipts.
- Low-control features should not appear in normal mode.
- Replay and receipts should be one click away from every command.
- Simulation and read-only modes should be visually distinct from live control.

## Reference Reuse

The sibling `../olu` work is useful for robot canvas, model loading, file IO,
hardware panels, and inspection workflows. Moonrobo should borrow patterns and
possibly code when appropriate, but the product should stay focused on:

- physical-world agent operation
- safety-gated command intents
- RobotBook evidence
- Moontown resident robot agents
- Rabbita cockpit
- Lepus desktop shell

## Near-Term UI Milestone

Build a read-only cockpit:

1. load an example RobotBook
2. display robot identity and model metadata
3. show mock bridge health
4. stream fixture telemetry
5. render a receipt timeline
6. show safety status as read-only

Only after that should the UI add high-control command proposals.
